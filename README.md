<h1>Dressing Room</h1>
<h3>a shopper's right hand</h3>
<br>
"Dressing Room" was an answer to my biggest problem -- I had no way to organize my dream clothing closets!
<br>
Built with a Rails backend, React/Redux frontend, and styled-components that work directly with React to style the page and optimize a user's experience. 
<br>
<h3>How to use:</h3>
  - A user can log in/create a new profile. 
  <br>
  - Once logged in, you are greeted with your home page. The home page holds all of your closets. Think of closets as mini collections of clothes. They are there to help you organize your thoughts (ex: basics, holy grails, essentials, 70s inspired, etc.) From here, you can add/delete closets, or click on a closet to edit. Once you're there...
  <br>
  - ... you will see all your pieces! 
  <br>
  - in the top right corner, click the little lightbulb button to take you to your inspo page. This page functions similarly to Pinterest.
