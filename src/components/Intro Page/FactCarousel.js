                <Item>The fashion industry emits more carbon than international flights and maritime shopping combined. </Item>
                <Item>In Europe, fashion companies went from an average offering of two collections per year in 2000 to five in 2011. Fast fashion companies offer between 12-24 collections a year. </Item>
                <Item>Up to 85% of textiles go to landfills each year - enough to fill the Sydney harbor annually. The equivalent of one garbage truck full of clothes is burned/dumped in a landfill every second. </Item>
                <Item>Most fibers used in clothing are polyester, which is a plastic found in 60% of garments. Polyester does not break down in the ocean, and releases 2-3x more carbon emissions than cotton. </Item>
                <Item>The fashion industry is the 2nd largest consumer of water worldwide - it takes 700 gals of water to produce one cotton shirt. Thatâ€™s enough water for one person to drink at least 8 cups per day for 3.5 years. </Item>
                <Item>The resale market is expected to outpace fast fashion within 10 years, according to the Business of Fashionâ€™s 2019 report on the State of Fashion. </Item>
                <Item>93% of brands surveyed by the Fashion Checker arenâ€™t paying garment workers a living wage. </Item>
                <Item>Nearly 70 million barrels of oil are used each year to make the worldâ€™s polyester fiber, which is now the most commonly used fiber in our clothing. But it takes more than 200 years to decompose. </Item>
                <Item>Less than 11% of brands are implementing recycling strategies for their items, and 3 out of 5 fast fashion items end up in a landfill. </Item>
